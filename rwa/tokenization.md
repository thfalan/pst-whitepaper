# Tokenization

PST tokenization refers to the process of converting e-commerce store revenue streams into blockchain-based tokens that automatically share business success with holders. This enables e-commerce value to be traded in crypto markets while maintaining professional oversight and risk management.

### Background and Necessity

Traditional equity markets and crypto markets operate as separate systems, making it difficult for successful e-commerce businesses to access crypto market liquidity. For e-commerce success to be tradeable in crypto markets, it needs to be converted into an appropriate form with proper controls and protections. This form is the PST token, which combines automated revenue sharing with professional risk management.

The process of capturing e-commerce revenue streams and issuing corresponding tokens is known as PST tokenization. These tokens become the key bridge between e-commerce operations and crypto markets, enabling various DeFi applications including liquidity provision and yield generation.
