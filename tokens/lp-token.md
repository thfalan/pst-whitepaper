# LP Token

PST Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens offer a unique opportunity to earn multiple revenue streams through a single investment vehicle. By providing liquidity to PST-stablecoin trading pairs, LP token holders simultaneously earn trading fees, store revenue dividends, and protocol incentives.

The yield structure combines three primary sources of return:

1. Trading fees (0.1% of all trading volume)
2. Monthly store revenue dividends in stablecoins
3. Protocol incentives from both RWA tokenization partners

LP tokens can be staked with longer durations offering enhanced returns. Through this combination of trading fees, store revenue, and protocol incentives, LP tokens provide an efficient way to maximize exposure to PST's ecosystem while supporting market liquidity.
