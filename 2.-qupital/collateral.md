In PST, merchant's access to their e-commerce platform and their withdrawal of revenue are managed using smart contracts.

Merchants can access their platform stores normally and able to perform withdrawals. Qupital monitors the KPI of the store incl. sales and inventory levels. If there are any abnormalities, Qupital is able to freeze merchant's withdrawal from Airwallex, and liquidate the inventory to provide downside protection to PST holders.
