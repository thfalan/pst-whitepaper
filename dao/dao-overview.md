# DAO Overview

Traditional equity offering drain investor value through multiple layers of fees:

Up to 15% investor value lost before trading begins, plus the lengthy application process and regulatory overhead, with no guarantee of success.

In contrast, PST DAO disrupts this model with the following:



<table><thead><tr><th width="193">Item</th><th>Problem</th><th>Our Alternative</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Investment Banking</td><td>Expensive and dump on investors on initial offering</td><td>Financial Advisor with performance-based vesting</td></tr><tr><td>Market Maker</td><td>High fee and high spread</td><td>Automated market-maker</td></tr><tr><td>Legal and Audit</td><td>Expensive and slow</td><td>Platform data oracle and smart contract based enforcement</td></tr><tr><td>Exchange and Infrastructure</td><td>High listing fee, barrier and regulatory overhead</td><td>Blockchain partnerships and DEXs</td></tr></tbody></table>

The value reclaimed is redistributed back to stakeholders of the DAO, this creates a fairer, more efficient market where investors capture the value traditionally lost to intermediaries.
