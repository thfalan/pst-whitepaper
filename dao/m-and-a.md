M\&A activities create substantial value for the PST ecosystem.&#x20;

By acquiring additional shops at 3-5x PE but trading at 10x PE market valuation, each acquisition immediately generates value for token holders.&#x20;

Merchants can fund these acquisitions through either cash payment or vested PST shares, enabling efficient ecosystem expansion without requiring immediate capital.
