# M\&A

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

M\&A activities create substantial value for the Royalty Token ecosystem.&#x20;

Merchants, by acquiring additional shops at less than 10x PE but trading at a 10x PE market valuation themselves, each acquisition immediately generates value for token holders.&#x20;

Merchants can fund these acquisitions through either cash payment or vested Royalty Token shares, enabling efficient ecosystem expansion without requiring immediate capital.
