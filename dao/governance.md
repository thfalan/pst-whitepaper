# Governance

Participants in the DAO contribute differently based on their roles, creating a balanced ecosystem of aligned interests:

**Merchants**\
Store owners pledge their performance metrics for immediate capital through PST. Must hit growth targets to unlock tokens, ensuring long-term commitment to success.

**Token Holders**\
Provide capital through token purchases and receive store revenue dividends. Hold voting rights on critical operations including store delisting, M\&A, and emergency measures.

**Financial Advisors**\
Drive market activity and promote PST, receiving vested tokens tied to growth targets. Maintain protection treasury to absorb LP losses and align with ecosystem growth.

**Underwriters**\
Screen and select quality stores for initial offering, monitoring financials and verifying growth targets. Conduct due diligence to maintain high-quality PST-backed assets.
