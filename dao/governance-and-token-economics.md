  Governance, Token Utility, and Fee Models: A Comprehensive Approach to
  Decentralized Ecosystem & Investor Benefits

# Governance & Token Economics

**1. Governance Model**

* **Decentralized Oversight:** The Royalty Token ecosystem is governed by a [DAO ](<../README (2).md#dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization>)that empowers Royalty Token holders (including stakers) to vote on protocol matters. This decentralized model ensures that strategic decisions—such as treasury allocations, merchant performance thresholds, and fee adjustments—are made collectively, reflecting the broad interests of the community.
* **Voting Mechanics:** Proposals require a minimum quorum (e.g., 15% of staked governance power) and must achieve at least 60% approval to pass. This structure prevents small factions from imposing changes unilaterally and maintains stability across the platform.

**2. Royalty Token Utility & Exposure**

* **Direct Exposure to E‑Shop Cashflows:** Each Royalty Token is directly tied to a portfolio of e‑shops, meaning that Royalty Token holders gain exposure to the underlying cashflow growth of these businesses. This creates an attractive, yield‑generating asset class that mirrors the performance of real‑world revenue.
* **Staking Product as a Regulatory Workaround:** Although Royalty Token themselves may be classified as securities, the staking product—where investors lock their tokens into the AMM pool—has been designed (and reviewed by legal experts) to avoid such classification. By converting direct revenue claims into performance‑based staking rewards, the product offers superior investor experience:
  * **Higher and More Stable Yields:** With yields backed by [ALAR ](<../README (2).md#automated-liquidity-assurance-reserve-alar>)and the Performance‑Linked Stake, investors enjoy competitive returns.
  * **Enhanced Liquidity:** Staked assets can be traded on decentralized exchanges with real‑time price reference.
  * **Regulatory Compliance:** Leveraging partners like DigiFT from Singapore, the platform adheres to full compliance infrastructure across multiple jurisdictions.
* **Utility Functions:** Beyond staking, Royalty Token serve multiple roles:
  * **Governance:** Token holders vote on protocol changes and strategic decisions.
  * **Fee Benefits:** Holders may receive fee reductions and bonus incentives.
  * **Network Participation:** The token is central to all economic activity within the platform.

**3. Platform Fee Model**

The platform's fee model is designed to align incentives and ensure long‑term commitment:

* **Performance-Linked Stake:** Merchants must lock up 15% of their market cap as a Performance‑Linked Stake. These funds are held in [ALAR ](<../README (2).md#automated-liquidity-assurance-reserve-alar>)and are gradually unlocked as revenue targets are met. This mechanism not only secures merchant commitment but also enhances yield for stakers by backing the Super Senior Tranche.
* **Management & Carry Fees:** The platform charges a 1% management fee and a 2% performance‑based carry fee—applied only if stakers are profitable over their staking period. This fee structure ensures that fees are collected solely when the platform delivers positive returns, mirroring best practices in private credit while maintaining transparency.
* **Urgent Liquidation Fee:** To discourage opportunistic short‑term staking solely for dividend capture, any unstaking within the first week incurs a 20% penalty fee. This fee safeguards the liquidity pool by ensuring participants remain committed for a meaningful period.
* **Spillover & ALAR Protection Mechanism:** 20% of spillover from senior to junior tranche flows to [ALAR](<../README (2).md#automated-liquidity-assurance-reserve-alar>). When ALAR covers the 11% senior tranche guarantee, junior tranche participants face an additional 1-month lock-up (or pay the 20% urgent liquidation fee to unstake early).

**4. The Business Hook**

By combining direct exposure to e‑shop cashflow with a sophisticated staking product, Royalty Token not only automates away traditional inefficiencies but also redistributes the financial incentives typically captured by intermediaries directly to investors. The integrated fee model—anchored by the Performance‑Linked Stake and bolstered by [ALAR](<../README (2).md#automated-liquidity-assurance-reserve-alar>)—ensures that all parties are aligned for long‑term growth. Meanwhile, our partnerships (e.g., DigiFT in Singapore) guarantee that the primary market is served in full compliance with global regulatory standards, paving the way for seamless listings and cross‑chain trading.
