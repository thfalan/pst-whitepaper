# Risk Management & Compliance

**1. Overview of Risk Management Strategy**

* PST protocol manages two primary risk categories:
  * **Credit Risk:** The potential failure of e-shops to meet revenue targets.
  * **Platform Security Risks:** Smart contract vulnerabilities, systemic liquidity issues, and governance risks.

**2. Credit Risk Mitigation**

* **Performance-Linked Stake:** Every merchant listing is backed by a locked 5% of market cap in ALAR, ensuring incentive alignment.
* **Qupital’s Risk Analytics:** Leverages API-driven financial data from 20,000+ e-commerce merchants to assess underwriting quality.
* **Revenue Interception Model:** PST’s smart contracts directly enforce a 10% gross revenue share, preventing underreporting.

**3. Platform Security & Smart Contract Protections**

* **Audited Smart Contracts:** All protocol contracts undergo independent security audits.
* **Multi-Sig & Governance Security:** Critical treasury decisions require DAO approval.
* **Regulatory Insurance Protection:** PST holders benefit from **regulated exchange partner insurance mechanisms** in jurisdictions where applicable.
