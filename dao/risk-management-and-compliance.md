# Risk Management & Compliance

1. **Overview of Risk Management Strategy**

* PST protocol manages two primary risk categories:
  * **Credit Risk:** The potential failure of e-shops to meet revenue targets.
  * **Platform Security Risks:** Smart contract vulnerabilities, systemic liquidity issues, and governance risks.

2. **Credit Risk Mitigation**

* **Performance-Linked Stake:** Every merchant listing is backed by a locked 5% of market cap in [ALAR](<../README (2).md#automated-liquidity-assurance-reserve-alar>), ensuring incentive alignment.
* [**Qupital’s** ](<../README (2).md#qupital>)**Risk Analytics:** Leverages API-driven financial data from 20,000+ e-commerce merchants to assess underwriting quality.
* **Revenue Interception Model:** PST’s smart contracts directly enforce a 10% gross revenue share, preventing underreporting.

3. **Platform Security & Smart Contract Protections**

* **Audited Smart Contracts:** All protocol contracts undergo independent security audits.
* **Multi-Sig & Governance Security:** Critical treasury decisions require [DAO ](<../README (2).md#dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization>)approval.
* **Regulatory Insurance Protection:** PST holders benefit from **regulated exchange partner insurance mechanisms** in jurisdictions where applicable.

4. **Price Stabilising Mechanism**

* During events of oversold, [ALAR](<../README (2).md#automated-liquidity-assurance-reserve-alar>) stabilises prices through buyback when token value drop below PE ratio of 8
* Similarly if a token is overbought, ALAR would sell the token when token value rise above PE ratio of 15
