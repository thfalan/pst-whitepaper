# Valuation

By default, merchants will be given a 10x earnings valuation on initial offering.

This provides a return of 10% APY not accounting the principal growth, with downside protection through inventory and cash flow governance.&#x20;

The offer is attractive to both investors and merchants:

* Equity-like products rarely pay a stable dividend of 10% APY
* Most acquisition of e-commerce shops only happen at around 3-5x earnings
