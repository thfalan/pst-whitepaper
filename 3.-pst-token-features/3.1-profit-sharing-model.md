# Profit Sharing Model

Merchant and Qupital agrees on a specific margin to calculate the Profit for distribution.

The margin is calculated based on:

* Cost of Goods Sold
* E-commerce platform fees
* Logistics fees
* Returns / defects
* Overhead

Depending on the nature of the shop, the margin is usually in the range of 10-20%.

**It is possible to change margin level as margin could decrease as the shop scales.**&#x20;

After the first anniversary of token launch, merchant can request to change by submitting audited financial statements, which Qupital will cross reference to e-commerce platform data APIs to ensure fairness to all parties and propose the adjustment to the merchant.
