# Profit Sharing Model

Merchant and Qupital agrees on a specific margin to calculate the Profit for distribution.

The margin is calculated based on:

* Cost of Goods Sold
* E-commerce platform fees
* Logistics fees
* Returns / defects
* Overhead

Depending on the nature of the shop, the margin is usually in the range of 10-20%.

It is possible to change margin level as margin could decrease as the shop scales. After the first anniversary of token launch, merchant can request to change by submitting audited financial statements, which Qupital will cross reference to e-commerce platform data APIs to ensure fairness to all parties and propose the adjustment to the merchant.
