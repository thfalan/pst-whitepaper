# Dividend

Dividends are paid when the deposit account receives fiat from the e-commerce platform. From experience, it is usually every 7-14 days.

After receiving fiat, it will be converted to stablecoin within 3 working days, and distributed to all PST holders. Which means there will be around 2 dividend events per month.
