# Crypto financial market

Unlike traditional equity markets, crypto markets offer continuous trading and programmable ownership through smart contracts. This creates opportunities for innovative financial instruments that combine the benefits of equity ownership with the efficiency of decentralized systems.

The key advantages of decentralized markets for business value trading include automated dividend distribution and transparent ownership tracking. However, these markets face two primary challenges:

1. **Lack of connection to real business performance** Most crypto tokens lack direct connections to business fundamentals, making their value purely speculative. This disconnection from real business metrics creates unnecessary volatility and investor uncertainty. While the crypto market offers superior trading infrastructure, it needs reliable mechanisms to reflect actual business performance.
2. **Insufficient professional oversight and risk management** While decentralization offers many advantages, the absence of professional risk management and business oversight can expose investors to unnecessary risks. The crypto market needs solutions that combine the efficiency of decentralized trading with professional business monitoring and risk management.
