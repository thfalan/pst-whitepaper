# Bridging TradFi Equity and DeFi

PST addresses the limitations of both traditional equity and crypto markets through an innovative approach that combines the best aspects of both systems:

1. **Excessive costs and time requirements → Efficient tokenization process** PST dramatically reduces the time and cost of making business value tradeable. Through standardized smart contracts and automated compliance procedures, businesses can tokenize their revenue streams in weeks rather than months, at a fraction of the cost of traditional IPOs. Furthermore, the process is proportionate to business size, making it accessible to successful mid-sized e-commerce operations.
2. **Barriers to value realization → Direct revenue sharing with professional oversight** PST creates a new asset class that directly connects token value to business performance through automated revenue sharing. Unlike traditional equity markets that struggle to value e-commerce businesses, PST provides a clear, performance-based value proposition. Qupital's expertise in e-commerce financing adds a layer of professional risk management, combining the benefits of traditional underwriting with the efficiency of blockchain technology.
3. **Limited accessibility → Global, continuous market access with real-time business metrics** PST operates on decentralized exchanges, enabling 24/7 trading without geographic restrictions. The integration with Amazon's Seller API provides real-time business performance data, creating unprecedented transparency for investors. This combination of continuous trading and real-time data creates a more efficient market for e-commerce business value.

Notably, PST also addresses the crypto market's challenges:

1. **Connection to real business value**: PST derives its value directly from actual business revenues, providing intrinsic value backed by e-commerce performance. The direct integration with Amazon's API ensures that token value reflects real business metrics rather than pure speculation.
2. **Market expansion through business performance**: With over US$1.3 billion in processed e-commerce financing and a track record of less than 0.1% defaults, Qupital brings institutional-grade risk management to the crypto market. This professional oversight makes PST attractive to both traditional equity investors and crypto participants, helping expand the overall market for tokenized business value.
