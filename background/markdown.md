# Traditional equity market

**Traditional Equity Market** Until now, businesses seeking to make their value tradeable have primarily relied on traditional equity markets that operate through centralized exchanges and regulatory frameworks. These markets have grown based on the advantages of standardized listing requirements and investor protections. However, why has there been a growing demand for alternative methods of equity trading? The challenges within traditional equity markets can be summarized as follows:

1. **Excessive costs and time requirements for going public** In traditional equity markets, accessing public trading requires extensive preparation and significant capital. Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) typically cost upwards of US$1.5 million in legal and audit fees alone, with a preparation time of 6-12 months. These costs are largely fixed regardless of company size, making them particularly burdensome for mid-sized e-commerce businesses. For instance, a successful Amazon merchant generating US$50 million in annual revenue faces the same listing costs as a billion-dollar corporation.
2. **Barriers to fractional ownership and value realization** Even successful e-commerce businesses face significant challenges in converting their business value into tradeable assets. Traditional equity markets maintain high barriers to entry through minimum size requirements and complex compliance procedures. This makes it particularly difficult for growing e-commerce businesses to access public markets, leaving them with limited options for liquidating their business value or raising growth capital. Recent examples show e-commerce groups listing at modest PE ratios (around 8x) despite strong fundamentals, highlighting the market's inability to properly value these digital-first businesses.
3. **Limited accessibility and trading restrictions** The traditional equity market imposes significant restrictions on trading hours, investor qualification, and cross-border transactions. Trading is typically limited to business hours in specific time zones, creating friction for global e-commerce businesses that operate 24/7. Additionally, regulatory requirements often restrict international investors' participation, limiting the potential investor base and market efficiency.
