# Introduction – Market Opportunity & Problem

Despite rapid growth, the global e-commerce industry faces an enormous liquidity gap that disproportionately affects small and [medium-sized businesses (SMBs)](<../README (2).md#medium-sized-businesses-smbs>). While [SMBs ](<../README (2).md#medium-sized-businesses-smbs>)in e-commerce generate predictable and recurring revenue streams, accessing affordable, institutional-grade financing remains out of reach. This creates a significant market opportunity for a new kind of financial solution—one that combines the stability of traditional finance with the agility and accessibility of blockchain technology.

Traditional financing options, including private credit and equity funding, fail to address this need efficiently. Key challenges include:

* **Inefficiency**: The traditional process of obtaining financing involves cumbersome due diligence, high fees, and slow decision-making, often leaving [SMBs ](<../README (2).md#medium-sized-businesses-smbs>)with delayed or inadequate funding.
* **Illiquidity**: Conventional financing models lock up capital for years, leaving businesses and investors with limited flexibility. For investors, the lack of liquidity in private credit markets is a significant deterrent.
* **Lack of Transparency**: Private equity and credit markets often lack real-time reporting, making it difficult for investors to track the performance of their investments or hold them accountable.

The **Liquid Royalty protocol** addresses these problems by tokenizing recurring e-commerce cash flows, enabling fractional ownership of high-yield revenue positions. By automating royalty sharing and implementing transparent, blockchain-based processes, Royalty Token removes the inefficiencies, illiquidity, and opacity that have plagued traditional models for years. This approach not only enables investors to access high-quality, non-speculative assets but also gives SMBs the ability to tap into new capital sources without the delays and costs associated with traditional financing.

At its core, Royalty Token is a **decentralized, blockchain-native financial ecosystem** that bridges the gap between traditional finance and the emerging [DeFi ](<../README (2).md#decentralized-finance-defi>)space. The protocol offers an unprecedented combination of institutional-grade returns, liquidity, and transparency—all underpinned by the reliability of e-commerce revenue streams.
