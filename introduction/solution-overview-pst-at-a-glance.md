# Solution Overview (PST at a Glance)

The **Profit Share Token (PST)** Protocol offers an innovative solution to the liquidity gap in the e-commerce financing market by tokenizing gross revenue into fractional, tradable yield positions. This blockchain-native solution combines the best aspects of traditional finance with the transparency, accessibility, and automation of decentralized technology.

**How PST Works:**

1. **Revenue Tokenization**: PST enables e-commerce businesses to tokenize their gross revenue. At the point of sale, smart contracts automatically capture 10% of the merchantâ€™s revenue and convert it into a stablecoin dividend. This creates an efficient, scalable revenue-sharing model that eliminates reliance on manual invoicing or merchant goodwill.
2. **Tranching for Risk-Tailored Investments**: Investors can select from different risk tranchesâ€”Senior or Juniorâ€”based on their risk tolerance. This allows them to align their investments with their desired return profiles, much like in traditional securitization models, but without the excessive overhead and delays.
3. [**Decentralized Governance**](<../README (2).md#decentralized-governance>): The PST protocol is governed by decentralized mechanisms, giving stakeholders a voice in decision-making processes, including the allocation of capital and protocol upgrades. This ensures that the protocol remains aligned with its user base and evolves in a way that supports long-term growth.
4. **On-Chain Transparency**: Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, offering full transparency and auditability. Investors can track real-time sales, inventory turnover, and dividend accruals, which builds trust and accountability in the system.

PST's unique value proposition lies in its ability to offer institutional-grade returnsâ€”10% fixed on gross revenueâ€”without the complexity and inefficiencies of traditional private credit models. Additionally, its hybrid Web2/Web3 architecture ensures seamless integration with e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Shopify, and [Airwallex](<../README (2).md#airwallex>), offering merchants a fully automated, frictionless way to access capital and share revenue with investors.

In essence, PST is not just a token; it is a paradigm shift in how global retail revenue is owned and distributed. The protocol democratizes access to private equity-like yields, offering investors an opportunity to tap into a highly lucrative asset class previously reserved for institutional players.

This diagram illustrates the **Profit Share Token (PST) Protocol** and how it tokenizes e-commerce revenue streams, distributing dividends to investors through smart contracts. Below is a detailed breakdown of each step:

#### **1. Revenue Generation by Merchants**

* **Merchant1** generates **â‚¬3,000** in sales.
* **Merchant2** generates **â‚¬5,000** in sales.
* Both merchants participate in the **PST Protocol**, which automatically retains **10% of their revenue** for redistribution.

**2. Revenue Capture by the Smart Contract PST**

* **Merchant1** contributes **â‚¬300** (10% of â‚¬3,000).
* **Merchant2** contributes **â‚¬500** (10% of â‚¬5,000).
* The total captured amount is **â‚¬800**, which is transferred to the **PST Smart Contract**.

#### **3. Transfer to the Smart Contract Dividend Wallet**

* The **PST Smart Contract** forwards the **â‚¬800** to the **Smart Contract Dividend Wallet**.
* This wallet is responsible for **automated dividend distribution** to investors in **USDC stablecoins** based on their token holdings.

#### **4. Proportional Distribution of Dividends to Investors**

The dividend distribution is based on each investorâ€™s **ownership percentage** of the **PST token supply**.

* **Investor1** holds **10,000 PST**, representing **1% of the total network**.
  * Receives **8 USDC** (1% of â‚¬800 converted to USDC).
  * Funds are deposited into **Investor1's Wallet**.
* **Investor2** holds **20,000 PST**, representing **2% of the total network**.
  * Receives **16 USDC** (2% of â‚¬800).
  * Funds are deposited into **Investor2's Wallet**.
* **Investor3** holds **50,000 PST**, representing **5% of the total network**.
  * Receives **40 USDC** (5% of â‚¬800).
  * Funds are deposited into **Investor3's Wallet**.

#### **Key Benefits of the PST Protocol**

* **Full Automation**: Revenue retention and dividend distribution occur **without manual intervention**.
* **Transparent & Trustless**: All transactions are recorded **on-chain**, ensuring **real-time auditability** and eliminating counterparty risks.
* **Incentivized Ecosystem**:
  * Merchants gain access to **instant liquidity** through tokenized revenue streams.
  * Investors receive **predictable dividend payouts** backed by real-time e-commerce sales.

This system allows merchants operating on platforms like **Amazon, Shopify, or Airwallex** to seamlessly tokenize their revenue while **providing investors with a new, automated revenue-sharing model**. ðŸš€
