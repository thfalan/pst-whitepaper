# Solution Overview (PST at a Glance)

The **Profit Share Token (PST)** Protocol offers an innovative solution to the liquidity gap in the e-commerce financing market by tokenizing gross revenue into fractional, tradable yield positions. This blockchain-native solution combines the best aspects of traditional finance with the transparency, accessibility, and automation of decentralized technology.

**How PST Works:**

1. **Revenue Tokenization**: PST enables e-commerce businesses to tokenize their gross revenue. At the point of sale, smart contracts automatically capture 10% of the merchant’s revenue and convert it into a stablecoin dividend. This creates an efficient, scalable revenue-sharing model that eliminates reliance on manual invoicing or merchant goodwill.
2. **Tranching for Risk-Tailored Investments**: Investors can select from different risk tranches—Senior or Junior—based on their risk tolerance. This allows them to align their investments with their desired return profiles, much like in traditional securitization models, but without the excessive overhead and delays.
3. **Decentralized Governance**: The PST protocol is governed by decentralized mechanisms, giving stakeholders a voice in decision-making processes, including the allocation of capital and protocol upgrades. This ensures that the protocol remains aligned with its user base and evolves in a way that supports long-term growth.
4. **On-Chain Transparency**: Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, offering full transparency and auditability. Investors can track real-time sales, inventory turnover, and dividend accruals, which builds trust and accountability in the system.

PST's unique value proposition lies in its ability to offer institutional-grade returns—10% fixed on gross revenue—without the complexity and inefficiencies of traditional private credit models. Additionally, its hybrid Web2/Web3 architecture ensures seamless integration with e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Shopify, and Airwallex, offering merchants a fully automated, frictionless way to access capital and share revenue with investors.

In essence, PST is not just a token; it is a paradigm shift in how global retail revenue is owned and distributed. The protocol democratizes access to private equity-like yields, offering investors an opportunity to tap into a highly lucrative asset class previously reserved for institutional players.
