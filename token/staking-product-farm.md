There are 2 tranches of the farm associated with PST liquidity pool:

1. **Senior** [**Tranche** ](<../README (2).md#tranche>)- for conservative fixed income type of investors, has highest priority of yield up to 11% APY
2. **Junior** [**Tranche** ](<../README (2).md#tranche>)- for more aggressive type of investors, any yield that exceeds **Senior Tranche** goes here

For example calculation refer to:
