There are 3 distinct staking products LiquidRoyalty provides:

1. **Senior** [**Tranche** ](<../README (2).md#tranche>)- for conservative fixed income type of investors who are looking to optimise the yield of their stablecoin exposure, has highest priority of yield from 11% APY up to 13% APY, the ALAR vault guarantees the yield of Senior Tranche
2. **Junior** [**Tranche** ](<../README (2).md#tranche>)- for more aggressive type of investors, 80% of the yield that exceeds **Senior Tranche** goes here
3. ALAR - ALAR takes 20% of the yield spillover to assure sustain the continuous overcollateralisation of Senior Tranche yield guarantee
