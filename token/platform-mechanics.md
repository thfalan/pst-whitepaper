# Platform Mechanics

**1. Asset Onboarding & Tokenization**

* **Merchant Registration:** E‑shops join the PST network by registering on‑chain and integrating with revenue tracking APIs (e.g., from Amazon, Shopify, Airwallex). Each merchant’s performance is transparently recorded to inform yield distributions.
* **Performance-Linked Stake:** At listing, merchants are required to lock 5% of their total market capitalization as a **Performance-Linked Stake**. This locked amount is held in the **Automated Liquidity Assurance Reserve (ALAR)** and is gradually unlocked in installments as the merchant achieves pre‑defined revenue targets. This mechanism not only secures the merchant’s commitment but also acts as a credit enhancement tool for stakers.

**2. Funding & Liquidity Pool Structure**

* **Pooled Staking Model:** Investors (stakers) contribute PST tokens to the platform’s AMM liquidity pool. Unlike traditional financing, these funds are not allocated directly to any merchant; rather, they are managed algorithmically by smart contracts. This structure protects investor capital by eliminating direct exposure to merchant operations while still allowing stakers to benefit from the underlying e‑shop cashflows.
* **ALAR Backing:** The funds locked via the Performance‑Linked Stake, combined with chain partner incentives (e.g., bonus OM tokens from Mantra) and stablecoin incentives (e.g., rewards in WUSD), form the **Automated Liquidity Assurance Reserve (ALAR)**. ALAR ensures that the most conservative investment tier—the Super Senior Tranche—receives a fixed yield of at least 11% annually, thereby underpinning investor confidence with a robust yield floor.

**3. Yield Generation & Distribution**

* **Multi-Source Yield:** Staking rewards are generated through three primary channels:
  * **AMM Trading Activity:** Swap fees from on‑chain trading contribute to the yield.
  * **NAV Growth:** As the value of the pooled assets appreciates, stakers share in this upside.
  * **ALAR Incentives:** Bonus rewards from ALAR—including chain (Mantra OM) and stablecoin (WUSD) incentives, plus gradual unlocking of merchant Performance‑Linked Stakes—boost overall yields.
* **Tranche Structure:** The staking pool is segmented into three risk tiers:
  * **Super Senior Tranche:** Offers a fixed minimum yield of 11% per annum, guaranteed by ALAR.
  * **Senior Tranche:** Provides priority payouts with expected yields between 8–10%.
  * **Junior Tranche:** Exposes stakers to higher risk in exchange for variable, potentially higher returns, and enhanced governance rewards.
* **Redemption & Exit:** Standard unstaking is available after the lock-up period. To deter short‑term dividend farming, early unstaking (within one week) incurs an urgent liquidation fee of 20% on the unstaked amount.

**4. The Business Hook**

By automating revenue capture and aligning incentives through ALAR and the Performance‑Linked Stake, PST redefines asset financing. It replaces traditional, opaque financing models with a fully transparent, decentralized process that ensures robust yield—even in volatile market conditions—while offering liquidity and ease of exit on decentralized exchanges.
