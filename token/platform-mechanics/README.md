# Platform Mechanics

**1. Asset Onboarding & Tokenization**

* **Merchant Registration:** E‑shops join the Liquid Royalty Protocol network by registering on‑chain and integrating with revenue tracking [APIs ](<../../README (2).md#api-application-programming-interface>)(e.g., from Amazon, Shopify, Airwallex). Each merchant's performance is transparently recorded to inform yield distributions.
* **Performance-Linked Stake:** At listing, merchants are required to lock 15% of their total market capitalization as a [**Performance-Linked Stake**](<../../README (2).md#performance-linked-stake>). This locked amount is held in the **Automated Liquidity Assurance Reserve (**[**ALAR**](<../../README (2).md#automated-liquidity-assurance-reserve-alar>)**)** and is gradually unlocked in installments as the merchant achieves pre‑defined revenue targets. This mechanism not only secures the merchant’s commitment but also acts as a credit enhancement tool for stakers.

**2. Funding & Liquidity Pool Structure**

* **Pooled Staking Model:** Investors (stakers) contribute Royalty Token to the platform's AMM liquidity pool. Unlike traditional financing, these funds are not allocated directly to any merchant; rather, they are managed algorithmically by smart contracts. This structure protects investor capital by eliminating direct exposure to merchant operations while still allowing stakers to benefit from the underlying e‑shop cashflows.
* [**ALAR** ](<../../README (2).md#automated-liquidity-assurance-reserve-alar>)**Backing:** The funds locked via the Performance‑Linked Stake, combined with chain partner incentives and stablecoin incentives (e.g., rewards from the use of Ethena USDe), form the **Automated Liquidity Assurance Reserve (**[**ALAR**](<../../README (2).md#automated-liquidity-assurance-reserve-alar>)**)**. [ALAR ](<../../README (2).md#automated-liquidity-assurance-reserve-alar>)ensures that the most conservative investment tier—the Super Senior Tranche—receives a fixed yield of at least 11% annually, thereby underpinning investor confidence with a robust yield floor.

**3. Yield Generation & Distribution**

* **Multi-Source Yield:** Staking rewards are generated through three primary channels:
  * [**AMM** ](<../../README (2).md#automated-market-intelligence-ami>)**Trading Activity:** Swap fees from on‑chain trading contribute to the yield.
  * **NAV Growth:** As the value of the pooled assets appreciates, stakers share in this upside.
  * [**ALAR** ](<../../README (2).md#automated-liquidity-assurance-reserve-alar>)**Incentives:** Bonus rewards from [ALAR](<../../README (2).md#automated-liquidity-assurance-reserve-alar>)—including chain and stablecoin (USDe) incentives, plus gradual unlocking of merchant Performance‑Linked Stakes—boost overall yields.
* [**Tranche** ](<../../README (2).md#tranche>)**Structure:** The staking pool is segmented into 2 risk tiers:
  * **Senior** [**Tranche**](<../../README (2).md#tranche>)**:** Offers a fixed minimum yield of 11% per annum, guaranteed by [ALAR](<../../README (2).md#automated-liquidity-assurance-reserve-alar>).
  * **Junior** [**Tranche**](<../../README (2).md#tranche>)**:** Exposes stakers to higher risk in exchange for variable, potentially higher returns, and enhanced governance rewards.
* **Redemption & Exit:** Standard unstaking is available after the lock-up period. To deter short‑term dividend farming, early unstaking (within one week) incurs an urgent liquidation fee of 20% on the unstaked amount.

**4. The Business Hook**

By automating revenue capture and aligning incentives through [ALAR ](<../../README (2).md#automated-liquidity-assurance-reserve-alar>)and the Performance‑Linked Stake, Royalty Token redefines asset financing. It replaces traditional, opaque financing models with a fully transparent, decentralized process that ensures robust yield—even in volatile market conditions—while offering liquidity and ease of exit on decentralized exchanges.
