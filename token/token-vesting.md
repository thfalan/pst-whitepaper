# Token Vesting

Initially only 10% of the tokens are sold in pre-sale and 15% PSTs are locked in liquidity pool, so whats next?

For merchants, unlocking their tokens is tied directly to business performance. This vesting mechanism ensures merchant interests align with PST holders:

**Growth-Based Unlocking**

Target: 200-400% revenue growth over 3 years

* Annual performance reviews using platform data oracle, measured at each anniversary of initial offering
* Each review can trigger token transitions from locked to LP staked status

**Unlocking Process**

1. Locked → LP Staked

* When growth targets are met, tokens move to LP staking
* PST are automatically sold to create matching LP pair
* Merchants are not able to redeem LP until 2 is reached

2. LP Staked → Liquid

* Only occurs when LP size exceeds 30% of circulating PST supply
* Excess LP tokens unlock gradually over 3 months
* Unlocking pauses if price stability is affected
* Dynamic adjustment based on market conditions

This mechanism ensures:

* Merchants stay committed to growth
* Market stability through adequate liquidity to protect against selling pressure
* Gradual token distribution based on performance

Financial Advisor (Qupital) is also subject to the same vesting requirements.
