There are 3 types of Farm (known as Tranches in TradFi) associated with PST liquidity pool:

1. **Stable Farm** - for conservative fixed income investors, has highest priority of yield up to 11% APY
2. **High Yield Farm** - for more aggressive investors, yield start from 0% (to compensate Stable Farm) and capped at 30% APY
3. **Degen Farm** - anything that exceed High Yield Farm goes here
