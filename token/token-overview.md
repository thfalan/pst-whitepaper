There are 3 types of PST at initial offering:

1. **Unlocked PST** - pre-sale tokens that are immediately liquid
2. **Locked LP Tokens** - enable more PST circulation through swapping against stablecoins
3. **Locked tokens** - Tokens that are vested based on time and shop performance

LP tokens based on PST allows additional yield types to be collected by liquidity providers, including:

* PST principal growth and dividend
* Liquidity pool trading fees
* Partnership incentives, including:
  * MANTRA chain ([https://www.mantrachain.io/](https://www.mantrachain.io/)) OM token ([https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mantra/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mantra/)) incentives for liquidity providers
  * Airdrop incentives from stablecoin partners
  * Financial Advisor marketing airdrop

The variety of yield allow LP token yield to be more diversified and less susceptible to impermanent loss. Referencing TradFi structured products, the yield is further allocated to **3 distinct Farms** to suit different risk appetite of LP investors.
