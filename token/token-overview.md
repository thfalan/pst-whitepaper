There are 3 types of PST at initial offering:

1. **Unlocked PST** - pre-sale tokens that are immediately liquid
2. **Locked LP Tokens** - enable more PST circulation through swapping against Stablecoins
3. **Locked PST** - Tokens that are vested based on time and shop performance

LP tokens based on PST allow additional yield types to be collected by liquidity providers, including:

* PST principal growth and monthly dividend
* Liquidity pool trading fees
* Partnership incentives, including:
  * Stablecoin partnership incentives
  * Brokerage partnership incentives
  * MANTRA chain (https://www.mantrachain.io/) OM token (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mantra/) incentives

The variety of yield allow LP token yield to be more diversified and less susceptible to impermanent loss (market making inventory loss). Referencing traditional structured products, the yield is further allocated to 2 **distinct yield farms tranches** to suit different risk appetites of LP investors.
