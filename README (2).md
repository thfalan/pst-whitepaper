# Glossary

#### **Automated Liquidity Assurance Reserve (ALAR)**

A decentralized reserve pool that guarantees minimum yields for senior tranche investors. It combines merchant collateral, chain incentives (e.g., OM tokens), and stablecoin rewards to stabilize returns and absorb liquidity risks.

#### **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**

A blockchain-governed entity where PST holders vote on protocol decisions (e.g., merchant onboarding, fee adjustments). Proposals are executed via smart contracts, eliminating centralized control while ensuring transparency.

#### **E-commerce Tokenization**

The process of converting e-commerce revenue streams, inventory, or store equity into tradable digital tokens. Enables fractional ownership and liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets.

#### **Key Permission Smart Contract (KPSC)**

A proprietary smart contract that binds merchant accounts (e.g., Amazon Seller Central) to blockchain logic. Automatically intercepts 10% of gross revenue at the payment gateway, ensuring tamper-proof dividend enforcement.

#### **Liquidity Pool (LP)**

A decentralized exchange mechanism where users stake paired tokens (e.g., PST/USDC) to enable trading. LP providers earn fees and incentives while ensuring market liquidity.

#### **Performance-Linked Stake**

Collateral (5% of merchant market cap) locked in ALAR. Gradually unlocks as merchants hit revenue targets, aligning merchant incentives with investor returns.

#### **Profit Share Token (PST)**

A digital token representing fractional ownership of tokenized e-commerce cash flows. Delivers automated 10% gross revenue dividends via smart contracts and grants governance rights.

#### **Qupital**

A leading e-commerce financier managing $2B+ in loans since 2018. Acts as PST’s underwriter, vetting merchants using real-time sales data and maintaining a 0.1% default rate.

#### **Smart Contract Dividend Wallet**

An on-chain, programmatic wallet that automatically collects intercepted merchant revenue, converts it to stablecoins, and distributes dividends to PST holders. Features:

* **Automation**: No manual intervention; payouts occur monthly via immutable code.
* **Transparency**: All transactions are logged on-chain for real-time auditing.
* **Security**: Funds are custodied in MPC wallets until distribution.

#### **Tranche**

Risk-tiered investment categories:

* **Senior Tranche**: Prioritized payouts (8–11% APY), backed by ALAR.
* **Junior Tranche**: Higher-risk, variable returns (up to 300% APY), eligible for governance rewards.

#### **Yield Farm**

A staking product offering tiered returns based on locked PST or LP tokens. Combines dividends, trading fees, and partner incentives (e.g., OM tokens) to maximize yields.
