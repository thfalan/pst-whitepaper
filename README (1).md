# Profit Share Token

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Qupital, one of Hong Kong leading credit underwriters, gains control of 2 components of merchant's e-commerce store to issue Profit Share Tokens:

1. Revenue Receiving Account: connected to a programmable bank account
2. Store Access: replaced with DAO-controlled credentials

In the first series of e-commerce tokenization, Qupital carefully selected 3 stores out of their portfolio of 10,000+ stores based on the following criteria:

* **Strong financial track record** - demonstrates high growth in the past 2 years
* **High growth potential** - merchants with a defined growth strategy according to their product expertise
* **Perfect repayment history** - merchants that have no history of delinquency

By transferring the store ownership to the DAO, the merchant is able to raise equity-like capital efficiently.
