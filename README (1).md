The protocol implements a dual-control system over merchant operations:

1. Revenue Control: Integration with programmable banking infrastructure to secure all sales proceeds
2. Store Access Management: Store credentials are encrypted and bound to smart contracts

This framework ensures robust investor protection through:

* Immutable payment routing
* Real-time merchant performance monitoring
* Encrypted credential management through blockchain technologies
* Smart contract-enforced operational policies

[Qupital's ](<README (2).md#qupital>)merchant network covers all of China, including Shenzhen, the world leading e-commerce merchant hub and Guangzhou City:

In the first series of e-commerce tokenizations, [Qupital ](<README (2).md#qupital>)carefully selects the best performing Chinese cross-border sellers from [Qupital's ](<README (2).md#qupital>)portoflio of over 15,000 stores.

[Qupital's ](<README (2).md#qupital>)e-commerce data integration tracks real-time multi-party performance metrics of all merchant stores, this enable [Qupital ](<README (2).md#qupital>)to analyze the following parameters with ease:

* **Strong financial track record** - demonstrates high growth in the past 2 years
* **Product edge** - Low return rate and low [DIO (days inventory outstanding)](<README (2).md#days-inventory-outstanding-dio>) indicates merchant is able to consistently locate high quality products in a highly competitive environment
* **Operational edge** - [Qupital ](<README (2).md#qupital>)analyses the full historical record of all the stores to find merchants with an operational excellence, such as merchants who are able to capitalize promotional events (e.g. Black Friday and Christmas) better than their peers
* **Perfect repayment history** - merchants that have no history of delinquency
* **Data Integrity** - Trustworthy data cross validated by multiple third party sources including ecommerce platforms and payment service providers

Royalty Token holders are able to partake in the growth trajectory of the merchant through a secured closed loop royalty sharing system.

By transferring the store ownership to the [DAO](<README (2).md#dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization>), the merchant is able to raise capital efficiently and cost effectively.
