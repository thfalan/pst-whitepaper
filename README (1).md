Qupital as a leading credit underwriter in Hong Kong, introduces a tokenization framework that transforms e-commerce assets into tradeable digital tokens.&#x20;

Through this framework, Qupital converts future cash flows and receivables and inventory assets into Profit Share Tokens (PST), enabling direct investment into e-commerce store's cash flow.

Qupital implements a dual-control system over merchant operations:

1. Revenue Control: Integration with programmable banking infrastructure to secure all sales proceeds
2. Store Access Management: Store credentials are encrypted and bound to smart contracts

This framework ensures robust investor protection through:

* Immutable payment routing
* Encrypted credential management
* Smart contract-enforced operational policies

Qupital's merchant network covers all of southern China, including Shenzhen, the world leading e-commerce merchant hub:

In the first series of e-commerce tokenization, Qupital carefully selects, top 1% of the best performing Shenzhen-based stores out of Qupital's portoflio of 15,000+ stores.

Qupital's e-commerce data integration tracks live performance metrics of all merchant stores, this enable Qupital to analyze the following parameters with ease:

* **Strong financial track record** - demonstrates very high growth in the past 2 years
* **Product edge** - Low return rate and low DIO (days inventory outstanding) indicates merchant is able to consistently locate high quality products in a highly competitive environment
* **Operational edge** - Qupital analyses the full historical record of all the stores to find merchants with an operation excellence, such as merchants who are able to capitalise promotional events (e.g. black friday) better than their peers
* **Perfect repayment history** - merchants that have no history of delinquency

By transferring the store ownership to the DAO, the merchant is able to raise capital efficiently.
