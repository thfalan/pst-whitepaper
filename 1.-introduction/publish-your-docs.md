# Equity Financing

In today's digital economy, successful e-commerce businesses face a fundamental challenge: how to make their business value **liquid** and **tradeable**.

Traditional equity markets (IPOs) remain the primary path to liquidity, but come with significant drawbacks:

* Costs upward of US$1.5 million in legal and audit fees
* Requires 6-12 months of preparation
* Success is not guaranteed despite the investment
* Process is the same regardless of business size

Yet companies still pursue IPOs for one crucial benefit: converting their enterprise value into tradeable shares that anyone can buy and sell.

With the maturity of decentralized exchanges (DEX) and smart contracts, we now have an opportunity to achieve the same liquidity benefits without the traditional market's inefficiencies. By tokenizing e-commerce revenues through PST, both businesses and investors can access liquidity faster, cheaper, and more efficiently than ever before.
