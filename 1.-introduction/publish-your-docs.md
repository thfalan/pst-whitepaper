# Equity Financing

In today's digital economy, successful e-commerce businesses face a fundamental challenge: how to make their business value **liquid** and **tradeable**.

Traditional IPOs remain the primary path to liquidity, but come with significant drawbacks - its expensive, slow with no guarantee of success:

<table><thead><tr><th width="139"></th><th>Exchange IPO</th><th>DEX Offering</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Listing Cost</td><td>US$1.5mil in audit and legal fees<br>Regulatory / compliance overhead</td><td>No Cost</td></tr><tr><td>Time Cost</td><td>6-12 months+</td><td>&#x3C;1 month</td></tr><tr><td>Recourse</td><td>Litigation</td><td>Automated through smart contract</td></tr></tbody></table>

Yet companies still pursue IPOs for one crucial benefit: converting their enterprise value into tradeable shares that anyone can buy and sell.

With the maturity of decentralized exchanges (DEX) and smart contracts, we now have an opportunity to achieve the same liquidity benefits without the TradFi inefficiencies. By tokenizing e-commerce revenues through PST, both businesses and investors can access liquidity faster, cheaper, and more efficiently than ever before.
