# 1.2 Problem Statement

### Current Challenges in E-commerce Business Expansion

Traditional financing options for successful Amazon merchants face three major hurdles:

1.  **Expensive IPO Process**

    1. Listing costs upward of US$1.5 million
    2. Takes 6-12 months to complete
    3. No guarantee of success
    4. Recent e-commerce listings trade at low PE ratios (â‰ˆ8x)


2.  **Limited Access to Growth Capital**

    1. Fixed repayment schedules don't match seasonal e-commerce cash flows
    2. High interest rates despite strong business performance


3. **Inefficient Investment Access**
   1. Investors can't easily participate in e-commerce success
   2. No way to earn recurring revenue from top Amazon store
   3. Private equity deals are restricted to large institutional investors
