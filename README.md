# About PST

Profit Share Token (PST) is an innovative RWA solution that transforms e-commerce business revenues into tradeable digital assets, bridging the gap between traditional e-commerce operations and decentralized finance. Partnered with Qupital, a leading Hong Kong-based fintech company with over US$1.3 billion in processed e-commerce financing and a proven track record of less than 0.1% default rate, PST introduces a new paradigm in business value tokenization.

The e-commerce market has experienced extraordinary growth, yet traditional methods of accessing and trading business value remain costly, time-consuming, and inefficient. While IPOs have historically been the primary path to liquidity, their high costs (exceeding US$1.5 million) and lengthy timelines (6-12 months) create significant barriers for most e-commerce businesses. The PST Protocol addresses these challenges by providing a sophisticated, automated system for converting e-commerce revenues into immediately tradeable tokens.

For e-commerce businesses to effectively participate in crypto markets, they need more than just tokenization â€“ they need a system that accurately reflects real-time business performance and protects investor interests. PST achieves this through direct integration with platform API, providing continuous, real-time monitoring of business metrics and automated dividend distribution. This technology-first approach eliminates the reliance on retrospective financial reports, dramatically reducing information asymmetry and enhancing transparency.

While the crypto market offers unprecedented opportunities for liquidity and trading efficiency, the challenge lies in creating reliable connections between digital assets and real-world business operations. PST addresses this through a comprehensive system of smart contracts, oracles, and automated controls. Our protocol maintains the security of traditional finance while leveraging the efficiency of DeFi, implementing sophisticated risk management systems including automated withdrawal controls and inventory monitoring.

The PST Protocol focuses on three key innovations:&#x20;

1. Automated dividend distribution based on actual revenue streams
2. Professional risk management through Qupital's proven underwriting methodology
3. Immediate liquidity through decentralized exchanges

We've designed a system where smart contracts handle revenue sharing automatically, while Qupital's expertise in e-commerce financing provides an additional layer of security through continuous monitoring and risk assessment.

To ensure the protocol's reliability and scalability, we've implemented a rigorous selection process for participating merchants. Only businesses demonstrating strong financial growth, market leadership, and operational excellence are eligible for PST issuance. This careful curation, combined with our automated monitoring systems, creates a new class of digital assets that combines the stability of revenue-based financing with the liquidity of tokenized assets.
