# Executive Summary

The global e-commerce sector, forecasted to exceed $8.1 trillion in annual sales by 2026, faces a systemic liquidity crisis that hampers the growth of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Despite generating predictable and recurring revenue streams, these businesses often lack access to affordable capital, while investors struggle to find non-speculative, high-yield investment opportunities in real-world assets (RWAs). Traditional financing models—relying on manual oversight, opaque reporting, and costly intermediaries—fail to bridge this $12 trillion gap in an efficient way.

Enter the **Profit Share Token (PST) Protocol**, a revolutionary blockchain-native solution designed to address these market inefficiencies. PST tokenizes e-commerce gross revenue, offering a seamless, transparent, and automated process for creating institutional-grade yield positions. By integrating the power of structured finance with the transparency and decentralization of blockchain technology, PST provides a high-yield, low-barrier alternative to traditional private credit.

Key features of PST include:

* **Enforced  Dividends**: Smart contracts capture a fixed 10% of merchant gross revenue at the point of sale, converting it into stablecoin dividends distributed pro-rata to token holders.
* **Hybrid Web2/Web3 Architecture**: Proprietary Key Permission Smart Contracts (KPSC) integrate with platforms like Amazon, Shopify, and Airwallex, ensuring automatic revenue sharing without merchant discretion.
* **Risk-Tailored Tranching**: Investors can choose from senior or junior tranches, aligning returns with their risk appetite while eliminating 80% of the overhead seen in traditional securitization.
* **On-Chain Transparency**: Every transaction, dividend payout, and governance vote is recorded immutably on the blockchain, offering real-time auditability.

PST democratizes access to private equity-like returns, offering institutional-grade profit sharing of 10% fixed on gross revenue with the liquidity and accessibility of public markets. Investors can participate with as little as $100, bypassing the traditional $500,000 minimums. Moreover, the protocol is collateralized by recurring cash flows from high-growth e-commerce businesses, ensuring stability and security for investors.

The PST advantage lies in its ability to replace manual processes and intermediaries with blockchain automation, enabling:

* **Predictable Yield**: Dividends tied to gross revenue, unaffected by operational costs like marketing or payroll.
* **Fast Liquidity**: Daily liquidity through decentralized exchanges, eliminating the multi-year lockups typical of private equity.
* **Transparent Operations**: Real-time performance metrics, including sales and inventory turnover, available on a public dashboard.

By 2030, PST aims to tokenize over $50 billion in e-commerce cash flows, positioning itself as the benchmark for decentralized private credit and a bridge between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi).
