They have disbursed over US$1.3 billion in loans across 10,000+ stores while maintaining a remarkably low default rate of less than 0.1%.

**DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**

A DAO is an online organization where members use tokens to vote and share profits. Unlike traditional companies with managers and boards, DAOs use smart contracts to automate decisions and distribute rewards. Members buy tokens to join, vote on proposals, and receive their share of profits - all handled transparently through blockchain technology.
