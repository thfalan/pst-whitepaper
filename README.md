# 1.1 About PST

Profit Share Token (PST) lets investors earn monthly dividends from successful Amazon stores. Led by Qupital, a Hong Kong fintech company that has processed over US$1.3 billion in e-commerce financing, PST automatically shares a percentage of an Amazon store's revenue with token holders.

Think of it as buying shares in an Amazon store, but with three key advantages:

* Monthly dividend payments
* Immediate trading through crypto exchanges
* Professional risk management by Qupital

Each PST is connected to real Amazon store data and automatically distributes profits to holders, making e-commerce investment as simple as holding a token.
