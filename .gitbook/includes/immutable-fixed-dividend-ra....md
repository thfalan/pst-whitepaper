**Dividend Mechanism: Profit Share Token (PST) Protocol**\
&#xNAN;_&#x41;utomated, Transparent, and Investor-Centric Distribution_

***

### **1. Fixed Dividend Rate: Immutable Investor Protection**

The PST protocol enforces a **fixed dividend rate of 10% of gross sales revenue**, irrevocably encoded into the smart contract at the pre-sale stage. This rate applies to all tokenized e-commerce stores and remains immutable throughout the token lifecycle, ensuring:

* **No Discretionary Adjustments**: Eliminates issuer or operator interference, protecting investors from dilution or arbitrary rate reductions.
* **Gross Revenue Basis**: Dividends are calculated on total sales (pre-expenses), insulating returns from merchant operational inefficiencies.
* **Smart Contract Enforcement**: Rate parameters are cryptographically locked, with no administrative override, even by the DAO.

***

### **2. Automated Computation & Fraud Prevention**

The PST protocol leverages **real-time API integrations** with pledged e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon Seller Central), payment processors (e.g., Airwallex), and inventory systems to validate revenue streams and prevent collusion:

* **Triangulated Data Verification**:
  * Sales data is cross-referenced across Amazon storefronts, bank settlements, and inventory turnover metrics.
  * Discrepancies trigger automatic audits, freezing dividends until resolution.
* **Trustless Revenue Validation**:
  * Blockchain oracles aggregate cryptographically signed sales reports from third-party platforms (e.g., Shopify, Stripe).
  * Smart contracts compute dividends using median consensus from ≥3 independent data sources.
* **Collusion Resistance**:
  * Merchants cannot underreport sales; revenue is intercepted at the source via Key Permission Smart Contracts (KPSC).

***

### **3. Key Permission Smart Contract (KPSC): Web2/Web3 Interoperability**

Stratosphere’s proprietary KPSC technology enables **blockchain control over Web2 assets**, ensuring seamless revenue interception:

* **Automated Revenue Capture**:
  * Merchants pledge Amazon Seller Central and Airwallex credentials, encrypted and stored in decentralized custody (e.g., MPC wallets).
  * KPSC-enabled smart contracts intercept 10% of gross revenue directly at the payment gateway, bypassing merchant control.
* **Zero-Touch Enforcement**:
  * Revenue is routed to a Smart Contract Dividend Wallet before merchants access funds.
  * Credential binding prevents store ownership transfers without DAO approval.

***

### **4. Stablecoin Settlement & Airdrop Distribution**

Dividends are distributed as **multi-chain stablecoins** (USDC, USDT, WUSD, HKDA) via a fully automated pipeline:

1. **Revenue Conversion**:
   * Intercepted fiat revenue is converted to stablecoins through licensed custodians (e.g., Circle, Tether).
2. **On-Chain Minting**:
   * Stablecoins are minted as wrapped tokens (e.g., WUSD) on PST’s native chain for cross-DEX compatibility.
3. **Pro-Rata Airdrops**:
   * A Smart Contract Dividend Wallet distributes tokens monthly to PST holders’ wallets, weighted by holdings.
   * Transactions are immutably logged on-chain, with real-time dashboards for institutional auditing.

### **5. Superiority to Traditional RWA Protocols**

PST’s architecture addresses critical flaws in conventional Real World Asset (RWA) models:

| **Feature**             | **Traditional RWA Protocols**              | **PST Protocol**                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Revenue Enforcement** | Manual invoicing, off-chain legal remedies | Real-time interception via KPSC           |
| **Fraud Detection**     | Quarterly audits, delayed reconciliation   | Instant API-driven anomaly detection      |
| **Dividend Stability**  | Variable payouts tied to net profits       | Fixed 10% of gross sales, immune to costs |
| **Transparency**        | Opaque escrow accounts                     | On-chain stablecoin flows, immutable logs |

***

### **6. Future Governance & Expansion**

PST farm stakers gain **DAO governance rights**, aligning long-term incentives:

* **Voting Power**: Staked PST/LP tokens grant proportional votes on mergers, acquisitions, and store delistings.
* **Privatization Events**: Token holders approve buyouts, with proceeds distributed as smart contract-enforced dividends.
* **Performance-Linked Unlocks**:
  * Merchants unlock LP tokens only after hitting revenue growth targets (e.g., +20% YoY), verified by oracles.
  * DAO treasury absorbs unsold inventory via automated Dutch auctions, stabilizing token liquidity.

***

### **Conclusion: Institutional-Grade Assurance**

The PST dividend mechanism combines **automated enforcement**, **blockchain-final transparency**, and **regulatory-compliant stablecoin rails** to deliver unmatched reliability for institutional investors. By eliminating intermediary risk and embedding investor protections at the protocol layer, PST sets a new benchmark for RWAs in decentralized finance.
