Berachain's innovative Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) model aligns very well with Liquid Royalty's **Low float High FDV** design with initial liquidity seeding:

At RTGE, pre-sale investors (10%) are locked up over 2 years, leaving only the liquidity seeded (10%) on Kodiak ([kodiak.finance](https://www.kodiak.finance/)) as the circulating float.

Royalty token is tradeable from day 1 with 24/7 liquidity, providing an active market price for merchant lockups, giving merchants both visibility and strong incentive to meet aggressive performance metrics (**commit to perform**).

Merchant hit performance metrics, more real world royalty cashflow are tokenized on chain and fed into the PoL system, attracting deeper liquidity and strengthening the premium.

This creates a flywheel where everyone wins:

* **Merchant** shops gain a liquid market reference plus a performance-linked stake - **more committed to perform**
* **Tokenholders** gains access to high-growth, incentive-aligned cashflows with deep liquidity powered by PoL
* **Berachain validators** secure a pipeline of PoL incentives that are non-BERA denominated and backed by high-growth, real-world businesses

Berachain builds businesses.
