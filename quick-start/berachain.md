Berachain's innovative Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) model aligns very well with Liquid Royalty's **Low float High FDV** design with initial liquidity seeding:

At RTGE, pre-sale investors (10%) are locked up over 2 years, only float available is in the Liquidity Pool deployed on Kodiak ([kodiak.finance](https://www.kodiak.finance/)).

Royalty token is tradeable on day 1 with 24/7 liquidity, providing an active price quotation for merchant's lockup, more motivation for merchant to meet their performance metrics (**commit to perform**).

Merchant hit performance metrics, more real world royalty cashflow are tokenized on chain and fed into the PoL system, pool attracts more liquidity.

As a result, everybody wins:

* **Merchant** shops have a liquid market reference plus a performance-linked stake - **more committed to perform**
* **Tokenholders** invest in high growth, incentive-aligned cashflows with deep liquidity powered by PoL
* **Berachain validators** now own a pipeline of PoL incentives that are non-BERA denominated and powered by high growth real businesses

Berachain builds businesses.
