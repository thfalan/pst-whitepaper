# Ethena USDe

LiquidRoyalty primarily uses Ethena USDe ([https://ethena.fi/](https://ethena.fi/)) for seeding initial liquidity at each RTGE.

In addition to the impressive TVL and reputation, USDe is providing yield rebate which will be directed as PoL incentives, boosting APY% of Royalty Token liquidity pools.

USDe does not have much liquidity on berachain, to acquire USDe, swap on Ethereum via a DEX (e.g. app.uniswap.com) then bridge to Berachain on [https://bridge.berachain.com/](https://bridge.berachain.com/)
