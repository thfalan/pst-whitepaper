# Royalty Token

Royalty Tokens by default are **10% Royalty Tokens**, which means for every $10 sales a shop made, $1 will be tokenized and distributed to royalty token holders via Airdrop.

At each RTGE (Royalty Token Generation Event), it doesn't affect day-to-day operations of the merchants, but they are required to follow a **Low float High FDV** model with most of their tokens (74%) locked in a **Performance-Linked Stake,** and 10% of FDV are used to seed initial liquidit&#x79;**.** Only if merchants hit their annual growth target (100%) a small portion of 10% is unlocked.

Royalty token holders are only eligible for airdrops if they are holding the token at the month-end snapshot.
