# E-commerce Lender

Our protocol partners with established, data-driven lenders who have a proven track record in the e-commerce financing space. These partners bring a curated network of high-performing online merchants and sophisticated risk management practices to the ecosystem.

The strength of our lending partners is demonstrated by their historical performance. For instance, a local Hong Kong lender, **Qupital**, has funded over $6 billion in merchandise with a remarkably low default rate of 0.1% across eight years of operation. This level of performance is achieved through a multi-layered approach:

* **Real-Time Business Monitoring:** Merchants connect their online shop APIs directly to our lending partners. This allows for real-time, transparent monitoring of sales performance, enabling dynamic and data-informed lending decisions.
* **Access to High-Growth Segments:** Our network specializes in high-velocity e-commerce segments, particularly Chinese cross-border merchants, many of whom consistently achieve 50-100% year-on-year growth.
* **Direct Cash Flow Control:** Through integrations with leading Payment Service Providers (e.g., Airwallex, Lianlian), our lending partners can effectively manage and secure cash flows, significantly de-risking the financing provided.

**Tokenizing Top-Tier E-Commerce Performance**

&#x20;The protocol tokenize these vetted businesses into Royalty Tokens. This process provides merchants with a novel form of non-dilutive growth capital and distributes real, revenue-generated yields to token holders.
