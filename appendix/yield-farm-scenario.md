# Yield Farm Scenario

> We have created a basic simulation to estimate returns for a $100mil Royalty Token tokenization here: [**https://liquid-royalty-sim.vercel.app**](https://liquid-royalty-sim.vercel.app/)
>
> Note: Numbers are only an estimation, the return is subject to actual shop performance, AMM activity etc.

Investors are free to subscribe to any of the 2 LP tranches, with Junior Tranche's principal being the return guarantee for the Senior Tranche

1 month later, the token value adjusts to reflect the required return for the 2 tranches:

Senior Tranche: 11% APY fixed

Junior Tranche: Principal as the return guarantee for the Senior Tranche
